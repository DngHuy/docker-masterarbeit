## Default Elasticsearch configuration from Elasticsearch base image.
## https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/distribution/docker/src/docker/config/elasticsearch.yml
#
cluster.name: docker-cluster
network.host: 0.0.0.0

## X-Pack settings
## see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-settings.html
#
xpack.license.self_generated.type: basic
xpack.security.enabled: true


## Set to false to disable the disk allocation decider.
## Default is true. Should be use in combination with the below configurations, if default value is used.
# cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled: false

## Controls the flood stage watermark, which defaults to 95%. Elasticsearch enforces a read-only index block
## (index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete) on every index that has one or more shards allocated on the node,
## and that has at least one disk exceeding the flood stage. This setting is a last resort to prevent nodes from
## running out of disk space. The index block is automatically released when the disk utilization falls below the high watermark.
## Similarly to the low and high watermark values, it can alternatively be set to a ratio value, e.g., 0.95, or an absolute byte value.
# cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage: 5gb

## Controls the high watermark. It defaults to 90%, meaning that Elasticsearch will attempt to relocate shards
## away from a node whose disk usage is above 90%.
## 0.9 | 90% | 30gb
#
# cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low: 30gb

## Controls the low watermark for disk usage. It defaults to 85%, meaning that Elasticsearch will not allocate shards
## to nodes that have more than 85% disk used.
# 0.9 | 90% | 30gb
# cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high: 20gb
